## **`RobustQuiz`**

Google forms, microsoft forms, etc, all have some element of quizzing in them. However, when I looked at Gforms, it was adequate for making a full form experience.
Some the features that are missing are as follows:

        1. Instead of one correct as with google forms, how about we could provide options that are all answers but have different degrees of correctness.
        A typical usecase is when you are creating an assessment in which you don't want to assess the participants peronality and biasisd instead of straightup right and wrong answers, then you could options within which their chioce tells more about their personlity. In this case, you could assign different points to the various options.

        2. How about you want to access people's leanings without points, say you want to label as something based on their choices. Eg: for every person who chooses option C is a gamer and that is all you want.

## **`ImmortalMe:`**

When people have funerals and events, there are numerous ways to share and distribute the pictures in the moment. However, is there a way to perserve those memories for posterity?
Will the unborn generation ever see grandma's funeral pictures? How about here wedding? ImmortalMe provides this avenue where you can save selected photos from an event and add some information the will help others find it later centuries to come.

    1. How many max photos should be allowed?
    2. What types of events should we consider aside funerals.
    3. should we allow videos?

    4. What will be the cost implications of storing data for such a long time?

    5. How will we price it? One time payment?

    6. Can people add info for others? for instance a dead relative who had a profile they were alive.

## **`Multi languaguage translation:`**

Using google translate, provide a website that allow translation of a word, sentence, paragraph, or entire passage to be translated into all supported languages at a go.

    1. Explore the google translate API to see how to use it for one language.

    2. The explore the possibility of using it for muliple languages.

    3. Is it possble to translate to muliple languages by one API call?

    4. If not, how would you build custom means to do that?

## **`Twi translation:`**

Design a language translation model.

    1. Study natural language translation techniques to build a model for existing languages.

    2. Train the model on basic Twi.

    3. Use the Twi bible as a test data set to train the model more accurately.

    4. Contact the bible society and other Twi publishers to obtain twi data for publishing.

    5. It Possible to provide one to one mapping of words from english to twi? For instance many proper nouns will never change form. So, providing the translation straight will speed up the learning process a lot.
